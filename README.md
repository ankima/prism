### Now it is oficial!

Bugs fixed!

Is Dracula theme for Prism.js missed? Don't worry! The geek and nerdy king Dracula has just built the theme for Prism.js with his MacBook full of funny stickers!

This theme was built at Prism Theme builder, developed by Sandras Hklyaeva. 

This theme code or pre body is using a new font called PT Mono from Google Fonts, an elegant monoscaped serif font, which looks like Dracula's serif font â€“ Abril Text. It also won a new scrollbar style and it is optimised for mobile and bigger monitors.
